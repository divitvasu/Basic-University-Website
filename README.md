## About

This project has been built from a demonstration point of view to exhibit the learnings imbibed from a internet programming course, during my undergraduate studies at Ganpat University. This project aims at developing a functional (base level) website for a University.

## Pages and Tabs

- The main page has tabs, which link to their respective pages or parts upon click.
- On the right a small calendar (month) is shown.
- The ‘Home’ tab routes to the main page from all other pages. 
- The ‘Courses’ tab links to the page with information of various courses offered by the university.
- The ‘Admissions’ tab links to the page with information of the admission procedure and the intakes of various disciplines.
- The ‘Campus’ tab links to the page with information of facilities offered and a few images of the same. 
- The ‘Faculty’ tab links to the page with information of the faculties.
- The ‘Contact’ tab points to the bottom of the page where the user can see the contact details and also send a message to the admin office for more information.
- At the bottom a map showing the location of the university will be placed in the Inquiry section.
- A ‘News and Events’ Section is displayed on the main page.

## Shortcomings

This is a very basic website, made from an exploratory point of view, aimed at learning the basics of web development. Thus, not a lot of focus has been made to improving the aesthetics of the same.
